# 1. Firmware Upgrade (upgrades.puffpaw.xyz)

\
Stay current, stay rewarded. \
Upgrade your Puffpaw firmware to unlock the latest Vape2Earn features.

Follow the guide at the link: [https://upgrades.puffpaw.xyz](https://upgrades.puffpaw.xyz)   \
\
Reminder: This upgrade is not mandatory but highly recommended - it enables the data caching of vapes while disconnected with the app. So that user can keep puffing without worrying losing the bluetooth connection. \
However, please make sure to connect with the app before the end of every day so that all puff datas will be included for the calculation of daily rewards.<br />
