# We Solved It

### Problem 1. How Vape Companies Put Profits Over Health

_**E-cigarettes started as a way to help people quit smoking. Now, they’ve become a big public health problem.**_

E-cigarettes were first created to help people quit smoking. They were meant to be a healthier option by giving nicotine in a less harmful way than regular cigarettes, according to [NHS of UK](https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/vaping-to-quit-smoking/).

The reality of vaping is very different from what was promised. Many companies sell vapes with high nicotine levels and artificial flavors that contain harmful chemicals. These could be even more dangerous than regular cigarettes.

It’s hard to track how much someone vapes each day, which can lead people to use more nicotine than they would with normal smoking.

The main problem isn’t e-cigarettes themselves, but the companies that care more about money than health. It’s even worse because vape juices often come from unknown sources, and some sellers use cheap, unsafe materials that can harm people.

### Problem 2. Distributors Take Too Much: The Hidden Problem in the Vaping Industry

This creates a big gap between brands and customers. It also causes problems with supply and demand.
