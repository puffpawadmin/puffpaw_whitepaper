* **Puffpaw Smart Vape:** Puffpaw users tie their Puffpaw Vape devices to the Puffpaw app. This allows users to start participating in the Puffpaw ecosystem using our patented hardware.
* **Gamification & Rewards:** The platform gamifies the process of quitting nicotine by rewarding users for reducing their nicotine intake. These rewards are recorded on the blockchain, making the journey to quit smoking more engaging and motivating.
* **Leasing & Borrowing:** Puffpaw Smart Vape holders who don't vape or smoke can lease their vapes via the Puffpaw Lending Program or lend the vape directly to their web2 smoker friends (borrowers). Borrowers will receive free vape & pods, and share the Paid to quit nicotine rewards with the Pass holder.
* **On-Chain Transparency:** All vaping activity and earned rewards are recorded on-chain, giving users a transparent and secure record of their progress. This data is self-custodial, meaning users maintain full control over their information
