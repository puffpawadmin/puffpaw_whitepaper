# Masterplan

Puffpaw aims to build a healthier lifestyle for the 1.3 billion smokers worldwide. It’s unfair to challenge human nature, expecting to change a long-established habit momentarily. Therefore, Puffpaw provides a solution with a proper incentive mechanism via an open RWA (Real world asset) protocol to monitor themselves and quit smoking in a completely sustainable way.

Puffpaw utilizes a feedback mechanism, enhancing support at critical junctures to fast-track not only the network's adoption (supply) but also the demand for it and the advantages for its users. During the initial phase of growth, our efforts are concentrated on developing:

* The production of Puffpaw Smart Vape and pod rewards early users with tokens for their contributions.
* The platform for staking, lending & gifting, and a daily health tracking mechanism.

Development will proceed through stages as detailed in the plan, with each phase introducing new functionalities, categories of devices for connection, and increasing degrees of decentralization.
