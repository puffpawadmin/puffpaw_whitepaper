### Market Overview and Growth Potential

Let’s start with the basics—the market is booming.&#x20;

We’ve crunched the numbers, and the global e-cigarette market is on a trajectory that’s hard to ignore.

We’re talking about a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.49% from 2023 to 2030. That’s taking us from a market worth $18.32 billion in 2022 to an eye-popping $46.98 billion by 2030.

_“Today, nearly 1 in 4 Gen Z adults regularly vapes. What if we encouraged them to choose healthier alternatives, like herbal tea extracts, instead of nicotine pods? Puffpaw is making that vision a reality. With their Puffpaw Smart Vape, users get more in-depth data on their smoking habits while enjoying a gamified experience to reduce their reliance on nicotine, a $430 billion problem. Puffpaw is tackling a massive market, and at Volt Capital, we're excited to support a company pioneering a new category in crypto as they work to curb nicotine dependence and addiction.”_
