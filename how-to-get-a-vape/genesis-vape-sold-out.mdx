### **Note: Puff Pass**

The Puffpaw ecosystem once used the Puff Pass NFT. This NFT acted as the Genesis Vape, except it was the NFT that was tied to the VAPE rewards earned, not the vape device itself.\
\
Since the launch of Gen2, Puff Passes are no longer in use, as Puff Pass holders burned their NFTs to secure a Gen2 Vape in a 1:1 basis. Now, all rewards are tied to the Puffpaw vape devices directly.

### **Basic Info**

Contract: [https://berascan.com/address/0x6a98fd0da1fc9fbbfcc83c6ee7e9f5904299dbfb…](https://t.co/uR64MAbsEl)

Puff Passes could be staked at [http://staking.puffpaw.xyz](https://t.co/rVMNMycKw5) to qualify for Paid to quit nicotine and future airdrops.

Buyers had to make sure to visit [http://checker.puffpaw.xyz](https://t.co/pTVynvEdhO) before purchasing on:

* OpenSea: [http://opensea.io/collection/genesis-puffpass…](https://t.co/7nrcPRaQCc)
* Magic Eden: [http://magiceden.us/collections/berachain/puffpaw](https://t.co/qNIlDKaTQy)

If the checker showed "vape has been claimed for this puff pass", it meant that buying that Puff Pass on the secondary market would not mean receiving a new vape!
