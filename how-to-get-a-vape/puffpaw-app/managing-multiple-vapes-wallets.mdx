# Managing Multiple Vapes/Wallets

Users can manage multiple Genesis Vapes across different wallets within the same mobile app. Wallet switching is required to initiate transactions associated with each specific Genesis Vape.

Due to hardware limitations, only one vape device can be connected via Bluetooth at any given time. Users seeking to operate multiple devices concurrently must manually disconnect and reconnect between devices to enable data caching.

It is also possible to access the same wallet on multiple devices simultaneously.

All Genesis Vapes—whether designated for personal use, the Puffpaw Leasing Program, or lent to another individual—are centrally managed within the app.
