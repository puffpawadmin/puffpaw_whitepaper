# 🤝 What if I don't smoke?



### <sub>**1) Participate in Puffpaw Leasing-Borrowing Program**</sub>

_This program is open to **all** vape holders._&#x20;

\
Holders choose to join this program will not receive the physical vape. Puffpaw will help to lease these vapes to the platform-signed KYC'ed borrowers and directly manage these leases.\
\
Holders will be able to recast their Genesis Vape rarity [production-economy.md](../puffpaw-token/paid-to-quit-nicotine-model/production-economy), check daily performances, and claim rewards in the app, same as other holders.\
\
To simplify the leasing process, holders (vape owners) shall pay 100% of all future pods and earn 100% of the rewards. Puffpaw will incentivize borrowers via other feasible means & methods.\
\
**Reminder: Holders shall check the pod balance in the app regularly to make sure that all leased vapes have enough pods.**



### <sub>**2) Hold Genesis Vape, and lend the vape to your friend who is a smoker, and help him/her to quit nicotine. (**</sub><sub>Leasing Your Vape to a friend = More Airdrop)</sub>&#x20;

You: Vape Lender\
Your friend: Vape Borrower\
\
**How to Lease** \
\
1\. Vape Lender send the device and the pairing code (shown in the app) to the borrower.&#x20;

2\. Vape Borrower connects the vape, enters the pairing code, and waits for the owner’s confirmation.&#x20;

3\. Rewards sharing starts at 90% (lender) / 10% (borrower) by default. Either party can propose changes later. \
\
Reminder: \
\
1\. The Lender is responsible for reordering pods when the low balance warning appears. \
2\. The Lender can use the vape and lease the vape at any time. \
3\. Both Lender and Borrower will be able to check the vape status in the app.&#x20;
