**1. What is the Puffpaw Closed Pod System?**

The Puffpaw Pod System uses pods that can’t be refilled or replaced. These pods are used in Puffpaw’s Smart Vape (PSV) and hold e-liquids. The e-liquids can have nicotine or no nicotine at all. This system is key to Puffpaw’s goal of helping users slowly reduce their nicotine use.

**2. Key Features**

* **Controlled Nicotine Intake**

The Puffpaw pods are designed to give users a precise amount of nicotine with each puff. This helps users control how much nicotine they use, which is important for those trying to quit.

* **Non-nicotine Vape as Main Option**

Puffpaw offers pods with different nicotine levels, including ones with no nicotine. Users are incentivized to slowly lower nicotine levels and earn more financial rewards (VAPE).

* **Organic and Safe Components**

The pods use organic ingredients and e-liquids that meet high quality and safety standards. This gives users a healthier choice compared to regular cigarettes or high-nicotine vapes.

* **Blockchain-Integrated Tracking**

Each Puffpaw pod is connected to blockchain technology, which tracks every puff taken. This data helps users monitor their progress, earn rewards, and ensures everything is secure and transparent.

**3. Incentive Mechanism**

* Users earn rewards based on how much they use the Puffpaw pod system, especially as they reduce their nicotine intake. The reward system encourages users to switch to lower-nicotine or zero-nicotine pods, connecting their health progress with financial benefits within the Puffpaw platform.
  * In summary: **The less nicotine you use, the higher the mining rewards.**
* **Data-Driven Feedback:** Puffpaw collects data from pod usage and uses it to give users personalized feedback. This helps them stay on track with their goals and motivates them to keep making progress in reducing nicotine.
