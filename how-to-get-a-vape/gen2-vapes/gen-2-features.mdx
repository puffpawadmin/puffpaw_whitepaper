## Key Features

Earn more by inviting others. For each friend you invite who purchases a Gen2, you gain +1.5 Wallet Social Mining Efficiency with no cap. Invite 100 people and earn up to 960,000 preVAPE. Each invitee also receives 2,400 preVAPE.

**First-Mover Advantage**

Gen2 is optimized for Web2 expansion. Join early and get ahead of the curve.

### Updated Mining Rules (effective on July 22nd)

* **Gen2 is not an NFT** — there is no staking or forced wallet binding.
* Mining rewards belong to the physical owner of the vape (for leased vapes, you can check your mining rewards in the app daily).
* Data follows the physical device. If it’s lost, all associated utility is lost.
* Wallet addresses and vape data are not permanently linked. Even if someone maxes out usage today, whoever reconnects and owns the device tomorrow earns the rewards.
