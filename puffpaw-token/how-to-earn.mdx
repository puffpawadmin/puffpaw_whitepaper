# How to Earn\*

### **1. Different ways to earn**

* **Paid to quit nicotine:**

Users earn tokens by using Puffpaw Smart Vapes (PSV) and reducing their nicotine intake. The more they switch to low-nicotine or zero-nicotine pods, the more tokens they get. This motivates users to make healthier choices while earning rewards for their progress.

* **Leasing Vape to Friends**

Users can lend their Puffpaw Smart Vapes to friends or others. The tokens earned from the vaping activity are shared between the vape owner and the user, creating a profit split. This lets users earn tokens passively while helping more people join the Puffpaw ecosystem.

* **Data Monetization**

Users can choose to sell their health and vaping data to companies like health insurers or tobacco companies for research. This provides another way to earn tokens while contributing to important studies.

### **2. How to earn the most**

* **Increase Mining Efficiency**

Mining efficiency determines how much your Genesis Vape earns in tokens. The higher the efficiency, the more tokens you can earn.

* **Use Low or No-Nicotine Pods**

Switching to lower-nicotine or non-nicotine pods is the easiest way to improve mining efficiency. Non-nicotine pods give the biggest boost, rewarding users for cutting down or quitting nicotine.

* **Upgrade Your Puff Pass (Recasting)**

Recasting means upgrading your Genesis Vape to a higher level. This increases your Genesis Vape’s ability to earn tokens by handling more data and working better in the network.



Puffpaw may introduce staking, where you lock tokens to earn rewards. Staking could also improve your mining efficiency, helping you earn even more tokens in the future.
