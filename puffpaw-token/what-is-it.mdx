**Major Utilities**

* **Payments**

The Puffpaw token is used to reorder pods, purchase future vapes and other products, or access special features directly on the Puffpaw Platform.

Puffpaw accepts fiat payments but offers discounts for payments made with the token.

* **Health Data Marketplace**

Puffpaw's target users are 1.3 billion smokers. Currently, there is no device or operation to collect respiratory disease-related health data. Puffpaw Smart Vape is not only a vape but also a data collector that enables smokers (data generators) to record, store, and monetize their data by selling it to data consumers.

In addition, since tobacco products are banned from paid promotion on social media platforms, smokers can only purchase from local smoke shops. Vape brands and manufacturers do not have access to such consumer data. Therefore, these companies are also valuable data consumers on the Puffpaw data marketplace.&#x20;

Such data consumers include health insurance agencies, pharmaceutical companies, health product companies
