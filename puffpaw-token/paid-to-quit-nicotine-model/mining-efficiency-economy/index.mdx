# Mining Efficiency Economy

#### What is Mining Efficiency?

Mining Efficiency is the core of Puffpaw's production mechanism. Users generate mining efficiency by holding and binding Puffpaw vape devices and pods to contribute hash power through daily vaping. Puffpaw Vapes of different rarities provide varying levels of mining efficiency to the ecosystem.

#### How to Provide Mining Efficiency?



**Vape Mining Output Calculation Formula:**

The Vape Mining Output is determined by the formula:

$$
\text{Vape Mining Output} = \frac{\text{Vape Mining Efficiency} + \text{Wallet Social Mining Efficiency}}{\text{Total Daily Mining Efficiency}} \times \text{Total Daily Release Amount}
$$

* **Vape Mining Efficiency Calculation Formula:**

$$
\text{Vape Mining Efficiency} = \text{Base Mining Efficiency} \times \text{Mining Efficiency Bonus Factor} \times \text{Health Factor}
$$

* **Base Mining Efficiency –** The higher the rarity of the Puff Pass, the higher the base hash power.
* **Mining Efficiency Bonus Factor –** The more frequently you vape, the higher the bonus Factor, capped at an upper limit.
* **Health Factor –** The lower the nicotine content, the higher the health Factor.
  * The initial tier of each Puff Pass (vape) is 1, and the base mining efficiency is 1.
  * Recasting can increase the rarity of the Puff Pass (vape), resulting in a higher base mining efficiency.

<br />

* **Wallet Social Mining Efficiency —** Not affected by the Mining Efficiency Bonus Factor or Health Factor, nor by reforging or upgrading.

<br />

* **Total Daily Mining Efficiency —** The sum of the mining efficiency provided by all vapes participating in vape mining today + the sum of the wallet social mining efficiency of all wallets.

$$
\text{Total Daily Mining Efficiency} = \sum \text{Vape Mining Efficiency} + \sum \text{Wallet Social Mining Efficiency}
$$

**Start Paid to quit nicotine Mining**

**Start Mining**

* **Staking:** Users must stake their Puff Pass (vape) before they can recast it.
* **Binding:** The vape device must be bound to a Puff Pass (vape) to earn rewards. Once the binding is confirmed, it is **permanent and cannot be changed**. Each vape can only be bound to **one Puff Pass**.
* **Daily Rarity Tier:** Starting from UTC 0:00, the rarity tier shown on the Puff Pass (vape) is used for that day’s Paid to quit nicotine mining. Any changes made later in the day through recasting will not affect today’s rewards.
