# Gameplay: Vape Mining

Genesis Vapes of different tiers have varying levels of base mining efficiency. The higher the base mining efficiency, the more hash power users can supply to the ecosystem through vaping, thereby driving the growth of the ecosystem economy. In return, users can earn more preVAPE rewards.

**Mining Efficiency Bonus Factor**

* Minimum Vape Requisite: If the actual number of daily puffs reaches the minimum threshold, the mining efficiency bonus factor is 100%. If it is below the minimum, the factor is calculated proportionally.
* Maximum Vape Requisite: If the actual number of daily puffs reaches the maximum threshold, the mining efficiency bonus factor is 300%. If it exceeds the maximum, the bonus factor remains capped at 300%.

Reminder: Users who do not vape at all in a day will have a mining efficiency bonus Factor of 0%. Since no mining efficiency is contributed to the ecosystem's growth, they will not receive any preVAPE rewards.\
