# Production Economy

To earn more mining rewards, users can choose to participate in the production economy, enhancing the rarity level of their Puffpaw Vapes through the following features:

* Recasting
* Pay-to-Upgrade

\
**Recasting**

The core of recasting lies in asset redistribution - users can consume preVAPE to upgrade the tier of their Puffpaw Vapes, thereby unlocking higher hash power. The recasting fee significantly increases preVAPE consumption, helping to maintain the orderly growth of the ecosystem.

Users can consume preVAPE to recast Genesis Vape. After recasting, they will receive a new Genesis Vape with a tier between 1 and 12. An increase in tier results in a significant boost in the base mining efficiency.

Recasting Balance: The preVAPE consumed for recasting will be regularly burned to maintain the ecosystem's balance.

When it takes effect:

* For Genesis Vapes recast today, the updated base stats (such as mining efficiency and puff count limits) will take effect the next day.
* Example: If the Genesis Vape starts at rarity level 1 as of UTC 0:00 today, it will mine with level 1 stats throughout today. If it is recast to level 5 by the end of today, tomorrow's mining will use the level 5 stats.
* There's no limit of how many recast can be performed within a certain duration.<br />

**Pay-to-Upgrade**\
\
Users can pay preVAPE to upgrade the tier of their Genesis Vape from the current tier (N) to the next tier (N+1), thereby gaining higher base mining efficiency.\
\
Upgrade Cost\
**The cost fluctuates daily based on the total network mining efficiency. Specific values are subject to the actual data in the App.**\
\
The consumed preVAPE is periodically burned.<br />

Genesis Vape Tier Reset\
When a user unstakes their Genesis Vape, its rarity will reset to level 1, and it will no longer be eligible for vape-to-earn. Once restaked, mining can resume.<br />
