# Product Activation

After the smart contract is deployed, Puffpaw Smart Vape and Puffpaw Companion App need to be activated and synced with the platform. This testing period is important to ensure all devices work properly before they are sent to users.

Once everything is set, the token will go live on the mainnet. This allows users to start earning rewards as soon as they receive their vape.

Non-smokers are encouraged to lend their vaping devices to introduce their smoking friends to the platform, with the chance to earn a share of the profits.

At the same time, a staking and lending protocol will be launched, allowing holders to either stake their Pass or lend their vape to others on the platform.

Devices will be shipped directly from our manufacturing facility. Please check the Disclaimer section for details on international shipping rules.
